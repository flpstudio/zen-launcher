# Contributing

This project is fully vibecoded — built entirely through AI-assisted development with minimal manual coding.

## Contribution Policy

**Pull requests and direct contributions are not accepted.**

The only supported way to use or modify this project is to **fork it and customize it for your own needs**. Feel free to adapt the code however you like in your own fork.

## Why?

Vibecoded projects evolve through a conversational, AI-driven workflow that doesn't lend itself well to traditional collaborative development. Accepting external changes would break the development flow and make the codebase harder to maintain.

## What You Can Do

- **Fork** this repository
- **Customize** it to fit your needs
- **Learn** from the code and build your own thing

## Feature Requests

If you have an idea for a feature, opening an issue is welcome. Issues that include a clear explanation of the desired behavior along with a proposed prompt (i.e. how you'd describe the change to an AI) are most likely to get attention and be acted on.
